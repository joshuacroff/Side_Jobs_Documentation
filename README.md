## Relocation Impact on Employee Commutes
**Overview**

I took on this project because I've recently become really interested in understanding what impact relocating an office has on employee commutes. My former employer relocated 100 or so of us from an office which was quiet convenient for me and many others to a location that was far from transit oriented and added about 20 - 30 minutes one-way to my commute! As a GIS Analyst, I thought up an idea to measure the impact of an office relocation on employees but haven't had a reason to apply it up until the last week.

A friend of mine is putting together some information to present to their employer which could potentially influence where they decide to relocate their office along with **_~170 + employees_**. Employers considering relocating an office in the Bay Area are uniquely challenged in a region where office space is often hard to come by and the cost per square foot varies greatly depending on what city you decide to relocate to.

In Q1 of 2017, the [**Annual cost to rent 20,000 square feet of office space in the Bay Area**](http://image-store.slidesharecdn.com/bb2f8eef-f098-402f-8611-205224c4cfd8-original.png) was at a high of **_$116.28/SF/YR_** in **Palo Alto** and a low of **_$25.29_** in **Walnut Creek**.

Besides price, employers are likely taking a number of factors into account when considering relocation such as **lease terms, layout, amenities (amenities offered on-site or amenities within a short distance of the office space), parking or adjacency to transit**. Often, impact on existing or future employees is factored in  but attempting to weigh the concerns of a large team can be tenuous. In a region like the Bay Area, you may risk loosing valuable employees depending on where you locate.

Faced with difficult multi-criteria choices like those outlined above, it's useful to leverage tools which can provide insights and ultimately inform where you choose to locate your office.

For this analysis, ArcMap was used to analyze the
