## Relocation Impact on Employee Commutes
**Overview**
I took on this project because I've recently become really interested in understanding what impact relocating an office has on employee commutes. My former employer relocated 100 or so of us from an office which was quiet convenient for me and many others to a location that was far from transit oriented and added about 20 - 30 minutes one-way to my commute! As a GIS Analyst, I thought up an idea to measure the impact of an office relocation on employees.
